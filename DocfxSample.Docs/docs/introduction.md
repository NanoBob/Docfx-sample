# Introduction

This page just serves as a demo page for documentation articles.  
These articles are just markdown files converted to static pages.  

You can link to [other pages, like the getting-started page](/docs/getting-started.html) from within these markdown files using regular markdown syntax.

## Code
Here's some random code:
```cs
public float GetMeaningOfLife()
{
    return 42f;
}
```
